The development sources are available through git at Github:

  https://github.com/GooseYArd/freeq


Autotools
---------

This distribution uses whatever versions of Automake, Autoconf and
Gettext are listed in NEWS; usually the latest ones released.  If you
are getting the sources from git (or change configure.ac), you'll
need to have these tools installed to (re)build.  You'll also need
help2man.  All of these programs are available from
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu.


Building
--------

After getting the git sources, and installing the tools above, you
can run

  ./bootstrap --skip-po

to do a fresh build.  After that first time, running make should suffice.

When modifying the sources, or making a distribution, more is needed, as
follows:


Gnulib
------

This distribution also uses Gnulib (http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib)
to share common files, stored as a submodule in git.


Gettext
-------

When updating gettext, besides the normal installation on the system, it
is necessary to run gettextize -f in this hierarchy to update the po/
infrastructure.  After doing so, rerun gnulib-tool --import since
otherwise older files will have been imported.  See the Gnulib manual
for more information.

Sqlite 4
--------

Install Fossil - http://www.fossil-scm.org

fossil clone http://www.sqlite.org/src4/sqlite4.fossil sqlite4.fossil
mkdir sqlite4
cd sqlite4
fossil open ../sqlite4.fossil
make -f Makefile.linux-gcc

Nanomsg
-------

git clone https://github.com/nanomsg/nanomsg
./autogen.sh
./configure
make

Msgpack
-------

git clone https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-c


Check
-----

wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/check/check/0.9.13/check-0.9.13.tar.gz
