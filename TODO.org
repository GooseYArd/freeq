* TODO to_db is not being run
  to_db used to be called after merging a table in receiver()
  we probably need to create a separate thread now that handles the to_db and generation rotation stuff

* TODO it seems wrong to have freeq_ctx in conn_ctx, if state is already there. How are they related?

* TODO to_db should be in libfreeq.c

* TODO aggregator
** TODO read list of IPs to invite
* TODO staticinfo/tableprov
* TODO jsoninfo
