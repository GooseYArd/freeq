* TODO freeqd.cc accept listen port from command line  
  need to be able to start several instances at the same time to test aggregation

* TODO enable freeql listener via configuration

* TODO aggregator   
  initially aggregator will just poll all the known publishers all the time
  we can implement a policy about not always polling later

  aggregator gets list (via config file) of nodes it should talk to
  agg sends message to nodes requesting tables (either list, or the whole thing)

 
* TODO staticinfo/tableprov
* TODO jsoninfo
